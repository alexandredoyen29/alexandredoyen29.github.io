- ⚙️ Bluetooth trackers are small, stand-alone devices that can locate any objects (Wallets etc.) at any time. Even though they are designed for that, malicious users can turn away them to spy people. The goal of this internship was developing a technique to detect those objects around a person. This internship was in line with the PhD of Katharina O.E. MÜLLER.
