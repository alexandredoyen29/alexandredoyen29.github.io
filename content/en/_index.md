# Bonjour !

![My picture](/img/PP.jpg)

I am Alexandre DOYEN, PhD student at [Binsec](https://binsec.github.io/). I work on backdoors detection in network protocols implementations with fuzzing techniques. I am supervised by [MichaÃ«l MARCOZZI](https://sites.google.com/view/michaelmarcozzi) and [Jean-Yves MARION](https://members.loria.fr/JYMarion/cv/).

My favorite programming languages are C, C++, and recently, OCaml. I am interested by the research around cybersecurity, and systems.
