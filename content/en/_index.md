I am Alexandre DOYEN, PhD student at [Binsec](https://binsec.github.io/). I work on backdoors detection in network protocols implementations with fuzzing techniques. I am supervised by [MichaÃ«l MARCOZZI](https://sites.google.com/view/michaelmarcozzi) and [Jean-Yves MARION](https://members.loria.fr/JYMarion/cv/).
